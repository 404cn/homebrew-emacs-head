Emacs Head is a GNU Emacs formula based on the original Homebrew
=emacs= [[https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/emacs.rb][formula]].

** Why yet another Homebrew Emacs formula?
Since the option ~--with-cocoa~ is not available in the latest Emacs
homebrew-core formula (see [[https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/36070][pull request]]), I decided to build my own
formula.

This formula currently supports:
- GNU Emacs 26.3
- GNU Emacs HEAD (currently 27.x)

Bottles (26.3) are available for the following macOS versions:
- Catalina
- Mojave
- High Sierra
if you need support for an older macOS version open an issue.

*** GNU Emacs running in GUI mode (27.x)

** Installation
You can install this formula using:

*** GNU Emacs 26.3
#+begin_src bash
brew tap daviderestivo/emacs-head
brew install emacs-head --with-cocoa
#+end_src>

*** GNU Emacs HEAD
#+begin_src bash
brew tap daviderestivo/emacs-head
brew install emacs-head --HEAD --with-cocoa
#+end_src>
