By default:
- gnutls
- librsvg
- libxml2
- dynamic modules

are enabled. If you want to disable them please use the above "~--without-*~" options.

** System appearance change

This patch is enabled by default and can’t be disabled. It adds a
hook, ~ns-system-appearance-change-functions~, that is called once the
[[https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mchl52e1c2d2/mac][system appearance]] is changed. Functions added to this hook will be
called with one argument, a symbol that is either light or dark. This
mainly allows loading a different theme to better match the system
appearance.

#+begin_src elisp
(add-hook 'ns-system-appearance-change-functions
          #'(lambda (appearance)
              (mapc #'disable-theme custom-enabled-themes)
              (pcase appearance
                ('light (load-theme 'tango t))
                ('dark (load-theme 'tango-dark t)))))
#+end_src>

Note that this hook is run early in the startup process, so if you
want your theme to match the system appearance when Emacs starts, you
can register your function(s) in your early-init.el. The hook is NOT
run in TTY Emacs sessions.

** Pdumper
The portable dumper is available in HEAD. To enable this feature
please use `--HEAD --with-pdumper`.

For a pdumper configuration example you could take inspiration from
[[https://github.com/daviderestivo/galactic-emacs][Galactic Emacs]]: [[https://github.com/daviderestivo/galactic-emacs/blob/master/conf/pdumper-init.el][pdumper-init.el]] and [[https://github.com/daviderestivo/galactic-emacs/blob/master/conf/pdumper-config.el][pdumper-config.el]] configuration
files.

** Xwidgets
This formula support via a (patch) native macOS X Cocoa Xwidgets
support via embedding a native webkit window. To enable this feature
please use `--HEAD --with-xwidgets`.

** Why yet another Homebrew Emacs formula?
Since the option ~--with-cocoa~ is not available in the latest Emacs
homebrew-core formula (see [[https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/36070][pull request]]), I decided to build my own
formula.

This formula currently supports:
- GNU Emacs 26.3
- GNU Emacs HEAD (currently 28.x)

Bottles (26.3) are available for the following macOS versions:
- Catalina
- Mojave
- High Sierra
if you need support for an older macOS version open an issue.

** About the logo
#+begin_quote
'Kitchen Sink' OS Announced

Coding has begun on a new operating system code named 'Kitchen Sink'.
The new OS will be based entirely on GNU Emacs. One programmer
explained, "Since many hackers spend a vast amount of their time in
Emacs, why not just make it the operating system?" When asked about
the name, he responded, "Well, it has been often said that Emacs has
everything except a kitchen sink. Now it will." --- James Baughn (http://humorix.org/10016)
