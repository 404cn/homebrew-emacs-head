* Emacs Head

Emacs Head is a GNU Emacs formulae based on the original Homebrew
=emacs= [[https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/emacs.rb][formulae]].

** Why yet another Homebrew Emacs formula?
Since the option "--with-cocoa" is not available in the latest Emacs
homebrew-core formulae (see [[https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/36070][pull request]]), I decided to build my own
formula.

This formula currently supports:
- GNU Emacs 26.1
- GNU Emacs HEAD (currently 27.x)

No bottles are available.

** Installation
You can install this formula using:

*** GNU Emacs 26.1
#+begin_src bash
brew tap daviderestivo/emacs-head
brew install emacs-head --with-cocoa
#+end_src>

*** GNU Emacs HEAD
#+begin_src bash
brew tap daviderestivo/emacs-head
brew install emacs-head --HEAD --with-cocoa
#+end_src>

** Compilation options
The following compiling options are available:
